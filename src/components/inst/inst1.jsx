        This experiment explores how people learn and remember unfamiliar flower species under a time limit. 
        There are two phases in this study. In the learning phase, you will study flower images and their names and try to memorize them. 
        In the test phase, you will match each flower image to the correct label based on what you learned. 
        Your goal is to choose the correct flower image for each test as accurately as possible within the given time limit.
